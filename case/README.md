Tomu Cases
==========

The Tomu PCB has USB contacts on one side, but the other side contains components.  The combined height may not be enough to keep the Tomu PCB inside the USB port.

Early revisions of Tomu used a piece of folded paper to keep the PCB secure.  These cases were designed to alleviate this need.

The cases are designed in FreeCAD, and are distributed both in their source form and their production form.

[tomu\_0.2\_case](tomu_0.2_case.stl)
-------------------------------------

This is the original case.  It is a rectangle, and should work well.

[tomu\_0.2\_case\_fancy](tomu_0.2_case_fancy.stl)
----------------------

This is a fancier case.  It is designed to work with 0.8mm boards, and has a space cut out for the MCU.  It has a lip on the end.

[tomu\_0.3\_case](tomu_0.3_case.stl)
---------------

The Tomu 0.3 revision includes notches on the side for alignment with the PCB.  This case is the same as tomu\_0.2\_case\_fancy, but includes nubs to mate with the notches.
